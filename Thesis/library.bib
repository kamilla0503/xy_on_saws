abstract = {Numerous large eddy simulations are performed of large wind farms using the actuator line method, which has been fully coupled to the aero-elastic code, Flex5. The higher order moments of the flow field inside large wind farms is examined in order to determine a representative reference velocity. The statistical moments appear to collapse and hence the turbulence inside large wind farms can potentially be scaled accordingly. The thrust coefficient is estimated by two different reference velocities and the generic CT expression by Frandsen. A reference velocity derived from the power production is shown to give very good agreement and furthermore enables the very good estimation of the thrust force using only the steady CT -curve, even for very short time samples. Finally, the effective turbulence inside large wind farms and the equivalent loads are examined.},

abstract = {Analytical and numerical models of the neutral and stably-stratified atmospheric boundary layer are reviewed. Theoretical arguments and computational models suggest that a quasi-steady state is attainable in a boundary layer cooled from below and it is shown how this may be incorporated within a time-steady, one-dimensional model. A new length-scale-limited k-model is proposed for flows where a global maximum mixing length is imposed by the finite boundary-layer depth or, in stably-stratified conditions, by the Obukhov length, whilst still reducing to a form consistent with the logarithmic law in the surface layer. Simulations compare favourably with data from the Leipzig experiment and from Cardington airfield in England.},

abstract = {An analysis and interpretation of measurements from a 138-m tall tower located in a forested landscape is presented. Measurement errors and statistical uncertainties are carefully evaluated to ensure high data quality. A 40◦ wide wind-direction sector is selected as the most representative for large-scale forest conditions, and from that sector first-, secondand third-order statistics, as well as analyses regarding the characteristic length scale, the flux-profile relationship and surface roughness are presented for a wide range of stability conditions. The results are discussed with focus on the validity of different scaling regimes. Significant wind veer, decay of momentum fluxes and reduction in shear length scales with height are observed for all stability classes, indicating the influence of the limited depth of the boundary layer on the measured profiles. Roughness sublayer characteristics are however not detected in the presented analysis. Dimensionless gradients are shown to follow theoretical curves up to 100 m in stable conditions despite surface-layer approximations being invalid. This is attributed to a balance of momentum decay and reduced shear length scale growth with height. The wind profile shows a strong stability dependence of the aerodynamic roughness length, with a 50 {\%} decrease from neutral to stable conditions.},

@article{Arroyo2014,
abstract = {This work explores the accuracy of two approaches that account for the effects of the forest canopy on the wind flow by using a RANS-basedmodel. The first approach implements additional terms in the RANS equations (canopy model), whilst the second one uses large values of roughness length and a zero-plane displacement height. The model uses a limited-length-scale k-" turbulence closure that considers processes occurring in the Atmospheric Boundary-Layer (ABL) such as the Coriolis effects. Both the forest and the ABL implementations are compared with experimental data obtained from 118 m high met masts installed in a large mountainrange site with mixed forest characteristics for neutral stability cases. In order to perform a meaningful comparison at multiple mast locations, a novel methodology is presented which allows the selection of a velocity bin for a given wind direction and a stability class that minimizes the error of using short-term measurement periods at some masts compared to long-term wind statistics from a reference mast. Based on the outcome of the model validation it is possible to conclude that more consistent results are obtained by the canopy model since it reduces the uncertainty in the selection of correct input parameters in the large-roughness approach. The errors in the vertical profiles of velocity and turbulence intensity are reduced by the forest model by almost 63{\%} and 11{\%}, respectively, compared to the standard configuration (no forest). The large-roughness method reduces the error in the velocity profiles by 54{\%} while the predictions of turbulence intensity are barely improved.},

@article{Bechmann2007,
abstract = {The use of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to predict wall-bounded flows has presently been limited to low Reynolds number flows. Since the number of computational grid points required to resolve the near-wall turbulent structures increase rapidly with Reynolds number, LES has been unattainable for flows at high Reynolds numbers. To reduce the computational cost of traditional LES a hybrid method is proposed in which the near-wall eddies are modelled in a Reynolds-averaged sense. Close to walls the flow is treated with the RANS-equations and this layer act as wall model for the outer flow handled by LES. The wellknown high Reynolds number two-equation k − ǫ turbulence model is used in the RANS layer and the model automatically switches to a two-equation k − ǫ subgrid-scale stress model in the LES region. The approach can be used for flow over rough walls. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed hybrid method, simulations of the wind flow over a complex terrain near Wellington in New Zealand are presented. Under certain conditions unsteady flow features have been measured at the site - flow features that could lead to high structural loads on a planned wind farm. These transient flow phenomena are reproduced with the new RANS/LES method. Additionally, the results from the hybrid method are compared with pure RANS results.},

abstract = {A linear model for neutral surface-layer flow over complex terrain is presented. The spectral approach in the two horizontal coordinates and the finite-difference method in the vertical combines the simplicity and computational efficiency of linear methods with flexibility for closure schemes of finite-difference methods. This model makes it possible to make high-resolution computations for an arbitrary distribution of surface roughness and topography. Mixing-length closure as well as E -E closure are applied to two-dimensional flow above sinusoidal variations in surface roughness, the step-in-roughness problem, and to two-dimensional flow over simple sinusoidal topography. The main difference between the two closure schemes is found in the shear-stress results. E -E has a more realistic description of the memory effects in length and velocity scales when the surface conditions change. Comparison between three-dimensional model calculations and field data from Askervein hill shows that in the outer layer, the advection effects in the shear stress itself are also important. In this layer, an extra equation for the shear stress is needed.},

abstract = {Nyg{\aa}rdsfjell, a complex terrain near Norwegian-Swedish border, is characterized by its significant wind resources. The feasibility of using mesoscale winds as input to microscale model is studied in this work. The main objective is to take into account the actual terrain effects on wind flow over complex terrain. First set of mesoscale winds are modelled with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical tool whereas second set of mesoscale winds are taken from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data system. WindSim, a computational fluid dynamics based nu-merical solver is used as microscale modelling tool. The results suggest that the performance of microscale model is largely dependent upon the quality of mesoscale winds as input. The proposed coupled models achieve improvements in wind speed modelling, especially during cold weather. WRF-WindSim coupling showed better results than MERRA-WindSim coupling in all three test cases, as root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 70.9{\%} for the February case, 61.5{\%} for October and 14.4{\%} for June case respectively. Raw mesoscale winds from the WRF model were also more correct than the mesoscale winds from MERRA data set when extracted directly at the wind turbine by decreasing the RMSE by 62.6{\%} for the February case, 62.7{\%} for October and 23.7{\%} for June case respectively. The difference of RMSE values between the mesoscale winds directly at wind turbine versus the coupled meso-microscale model outputs are not conclusive enough to indicate any specific trend.},

This paper provides a perspective on the past, present and future of CWE. It addresses three key illustrations of the success of CWE: (1) the establishment of CWE as an individual research and application area in wind engineering with its own successful conference series under the umbrella of the International Association of Wind Engineering (IAWE); (2) the increasing range of topics covered in CWE; and (3) the history of overview and review papers in CWE. The paper also outlines some of the earliest achievements in CWE and the resulting development of best practice guidelines. It provides some views on the complementary relationship between reduced-scale wind-tunnel testing and CFD. It re-iterates some important quotes made by CWE and/or CFD researchers in the past, many of which are still equally valid today and which are provided without additional comments, to let the quotes speak for themselves. Next, as application examples to the foregoing sections, the paper provides a more detailed view on CFD simulation of pedestrian-level wind conditions around buildings, CFD simulation of natural ventilation of buildings and CFD simulation of wind-driven rain on building facades.

abstract = {This study presents wind measurements carried out in medium complex terrain at a site near Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Wind conditions and meteorological conditions were expected to be very extreme, in particular the so called Bora wind system showing very high wind speeds and turbulence intensities. Wind measurements were carried out with a 30m mast, a SODAR and a LIDAR. In this case study results of an 18 days period of wind measurements are analysed when data from mast, SODAR and LIDAR where available. The results from the LIDAR measurement where further used to validate simulations carried out with the CFD model WindSim. The two motivations of the study were, first, to test the performance of SODAR and LIDAR technique under harsh meteorological conditions and second, to analyse the suitability of the site in view of the planned wind farm and determine technical requirements for the wind turbines. Both, SODAR and LIDAR data showed good agreement and good performance with high data availability up to 100m. However, at wind speeds over 20m/s the availability from the SODAR data was strongly reduced due to high surrounding noise of the wind. Wind speed shear exhibited a rather small increase of wind speed with height especially for the prevailing wind direction NNE. Turbulence intensities calculated from SODAR and LIDAR showed biases in particular for wind speeds greater 15m/s. However, all data sets revealed almost constant turbulence intensities between 30m and 100m above ground and, in contrast to the expectations, turbulence intensities remained below class C considering IEC 61400 standard. Modelled vertical profiles from the CFD model WindSim were compared to LIDAR measurements for twelve 30° wind direction sectors. The normalised vertical wind speed profiles of LIDAR and WindSim showed good agreement. However, in contrast to the LIDAR measurements, WindSim showed a small decrease of turbulence intensity with height.},

Calculations were performed on a wide range of numerical grids to assess, among other things, the importance of spatial discretization and the limitations of the turbulence model. Our results showed that a relatively coarse grid was enough to resolve the flow in the upstream region of the hill; at the hilltop, 10 m above the ground, the speed-up was 10{\%} less than the experimental value. The flow's most prominent feature was a recirculating region in the lee of the hill, which determined the main characteristics of the whole downstream flow. This region had an intermittent nature and could be fully captured only in the case of a time-dependent formulation and a third-order discretization of the advective terms. The reduction of the characteristic roughness near the top of the hill was also taken into account, showing the importance of this parameter, particularly in the flow close to the ground at the summit and in the downstream side of the hill. Calculations involving an enlarged area around the Askervein Hill showed that the presence of the nearby topography affected the flow neither at the top nor downstream of the Askervein Hill.},

@article{Chou1945,
abstract = {1. Introduction. The theory of turbulence, as developed from Reynolds' point of view, is based upon the equations of turbulent fluctuation [l] and has been applied to the solutions of various special problems [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Owing to present cir-cumstances, these papers either have not been submitted to scientific journals for publication or are already printed but have failed to appear before the scientific public. The theory in its original form and its applications has three apparent diffi-culties: first, the equations of correlation of the second, third or even higher orders constructed out of the equations of turbulent fluctuation contain the unknown terms of correlation between the pressure and velocity fluctuations; secondly, there exist in these equations the terms of decay of turbulence the values of which have to be determined; thirdly, when the differential equations of the velocity correlations of a given order are derived from the equations of turbulent fluctuation, the presence of the inertia terms causes the appearance of the velocity correlations of the next higher order, which are also unknown. This has been pointed out by von K{\&}rman and Howarth [8] in their theory of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In the present paper we shall show that the pressure fluctuation can be derived from the equations of turbulent fluctuation, and is expressible as a function of the velocity fluctuation, the mean velocity inside the fluid volume, and the pressure fluctuation on the boundary. We shall also show that the decay terms can be put into simpler and more familiar forms by kinematic considerations. A general equation of vorticity decay will be derived for the determination of Taylor's scale of the micro-turbulence which appears in the decay term; in the case of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, this equation was given first by von Karman [8]. To get over the third difficulty we shall compare the orders of magnitudes of the different terms in the equa-tions of triple correlation. We shall find that the term involving the divergence of the quadruple correlation is actually smaller than the correlation between the pres-sure gradient and the two components of velocity fluctuation, and can therefore be neglected as a first approximation. From this we can also understand why, for the flows in channels and pipes in which the mean velocity profile is comparatively steep, particularly in the neighborhood of the walls, all the equations of mean motion and the equations of double and triple correlation are necessary to describe the phenomena of turbulent motions of fluids. On the other hand, as a consequence of the approxima-tion based on the fact that the divergence of the quadruple correlation is smaller than the correlation between the pressure gradient and the two components of veloc-ity fluctuation, we can stop at the equations of triple correlation instead of building equations of higher orders. As a matter of fact, for the flows in jets [3] and wakes [4]},

Original boundary conditions were also proposed for the ground boundary within the forest. The model was solved using FLUENT 6.2 and validated against field measurements from three different authors.

To address the problem of high spatial variation of the topography on the domain lateral boundaries between NWP and CFD domain boundaries, 3 methods - translation, extrapolation and Cressman interpolation are used to impose the NWP model data on the CFD domain lateral boundaries. Newtonian relaxation data assimilation technique is used to incorporate the field measurement data into the CFD simulations. These techniques are studied in a complex site located in southern France. Comparison of wind profiles between the CFD simulation, measurements and CFD simulation with data assimilation are discussed. This combination of state-of-the-art techniques in NWP, CFD, and field data assimilation will provide the basis of a more accurate wind resource assessment method.},

abstract = {The single-point statistics of turbulence in the 'roughness sub-layer' occupied by the plant canopy and the air layer just above it differ significantly from those in the surface layer. The mean velocity profile is inflected, second moments are strongly inhomogeneous with height, skewnesses are large, and second-moment budg-ets are far from local equilibrium. Velocity moments scale with single length and time scales throughout the layer rather than depending on height. Large coherent structures control turbulence dynamics. Sweeps rather than ejections dominate eddy fluxes and a typical large eddy consists of a pair of counter-rotating streamwise vortices, the downdraft between the vortex pair generating the sweep. Comparison with the statis-tics and instability modes of the plane mixing layer shows that the latter rather than the boundary layer is the appropriate model for canopy flow and that the dominant large eddies are the result of an inviscid instability of the inflected mean velocity profile. Aerodynamic drag on the foliage is the cause both of the unstable inflected velocity profile and of a 'spectral short cut' mechanism that removes energy from large eddies and diverts it to fine scales, where it is rapidly dissipated, bypassing the inertial eddy-cascade. Total dissipation rates are very large in the canopy as a result of the fine-scale shear layers that develop around the foliage.},

Furthermore, three-dimensional calculations were conducted in order to investigate the infl uence of the clearing shape. The numerical results were validated against our own wind tunnel data. The impact of the clearing width on the fl ow fi eld is marginal above and within the upstream forest area, but signifi cant further downwind. With increasing clearing width, the volume fl ux through the downstream forest and the streamline patterns resemble more and more those of an individual forest stand. For the forest confi guration with maximum investigated clearing width (a / H = 11, where H is the forest height), the fl ow around the forest downstream of the clearing is still clearly affected by the presence of the upstream forest area. With increasing clearing width, the mean bending moment coeffi cients of trees standing near the leeward clearing edges increase gradually.

As simple, standard Boussinesq-viscosity turbulence models have proven insufficient to correctly predict complex flow situations, attention is drawn to more reliable approaches towards the modelling of turbulence. This work aims at assessing the potential of Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Models (EARSM) for application-oriented aerodynamic computations. To this end, two different EARSM are investigated on a variety of configurations in sub- and transonic steady flow, ranging from 2D aerofoils to 3D wing/body-configurations. Is is demonstrated that an increased over-all simulation quality is achieved. Thus, while their overhead with respect to standard linear approaches remains limited, EARSM constitute a valuable extension to the model range available to the aerodynamic design engineer. ?? 2005 Elsevier SAS.

The mean statistics of the turbulence and the turbulence spectra are compared with observations in other crops and complementary wind-tunnel studies using 1 : 75 scale plastic trees. The measurements show that momentum transport and the subsequent motion of the trees is dominated by intermittent sweep/ ejection events associated with 'honami' waves moving across the forest. The trees themselves act as forced damped harmonic oscillators and appear to short circuit the normal turbulent energy dissipation process by efficiently absorbing energy at their resonant frequencies. It is argued that understanding the nature and formation of 'bonami' waves over forests and crops is a crucial problem in agricultural and forest meteorology because of their important role both in turbulent transport and in causing wind damage.},

Although the form of this implicit algebraic equation differed from previous implicit forms, its correctness was argued based on the objective tensor form of the implicit algebraic equation. It is shown here that such conclusions based on simple coordinate frame transformations are incomplete, and that additional considerations taking into account flow rotation and curvature, for example, are necessary. By properly accounting for both the arbitrary motions of the observer coordinate frame as well as the motion of the flow itself, it is shown that previous formulations and application of the weak-equilibrium condition are correct in contrast to the results of Weis {\&} Hutter.},

important applications including understanding CO2 and other gaseous fluxes over forests
in complex terrain, predicting wind damage to trees, and modelling wind energy potential
at forested sites. Current modelling studies have focussed almost exclusively on highly idealized,
and usually fully forested, hills. Here, we present model results for a site on the Isle
of Arran, Scotland with complex terrain and heterogeneous forest canopy. The model uses
an explicit representation of the canopy and a 1.5-order turbulence closure for flow within
and above the canopy. The validity of the closure scheme is assessed using turbulence data
from a field experiment before comparing predictions of the full model with field observations.
For near-neutral stability, the results compare well with the observations, showing that
such a relatively simple canopy model can accurately reproduce the flow patterns observed
over complex terrain and realistic, variable forest cover, while at the same time remaining
computationally feasible for real case studies. The model allows closer examination of
the flow separation observed over complex forested terrain. Comparisons with model simulations
using a roughness length parametrization show significant differences, particularly
with respect to flow separation, highlighting the need to explicitly model the forest canopy
if detailed predictions of near-surface flow around forests are required.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new method for estimation of vertical leaf area density (LAD) profile of tree canopy using portable scanning lidar is proposed. In this method, which we refer to as the voxel-based canopy profiling (VCP) method, several measurement points surrounding the canopy and optimally inclined laser beams are adopted to facilitate full laser beam illumination of whole canopy up to the internal. After the scanning, each data obtained from each measurement point are co-registered and the 3-D information is reproduced as the voxel attributes in the 3-D voxel array. Based on the voxel attributes, contact frequency of laser beams on leaves is computed and LAD in each horizontal layer is obtained. In addition, influence of non-photosynthetic tissues and leaf inclination angle on the LAD estimation are corrected. Using the method, good agreement between estimated and actual LAD was obtained in an individual tree of Camellia sasanqua. Next, the method was applied to broad leaved woody canopy of Japanese zelkova (Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino). In the experiment, LAD profiles had different accuracy depending on each quadrat established on the measurement plot and on the laser incident angles. From the results, it was shown that the number of laser beam incidences N and G( c) (the mean projection of a unit leaf area on a plane perpendicular to the direction of the laser beam) are the factors to influence the accuracy of LAD estimation.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by a wide range of canopy vegetation density, which is known to affect turbulent transport processes across the canopy-atmosphere interface. In the presence of a dense and horizontally homogeneous canopy, the canopy sublayer has been described as resembling a plane mixing layer. At the other extreme, where the canopy is essentially absent, the canopy sublayer is typically assumed to be similar to a turbulent boundary layer over a rough surface. However, it remains unclear how the canopy turbulence changes from boundary-layer-like to mixing-layer-like as the vegetation density increases. We use large-eddy simulation to study five different vegetation densities varying from an extremely sparse canopy to an extremely dense canopy. This investigation draws on the study of flow statistics as well as large-scale coherent turbulent structures within the canopy sublayer. The coherent structures are identified through the use of proper orthogonal decomposition. The results of skewness of velocity components and characteristic length scales suggest that, as the vegetation density increases, the canopy turbulence gradually undergoes a transition from resembling a rough-wall boundary layer to being similar to a mixing layer. As demonstrated by others, we found that the coherent structures within the canopy sublayer consist of a strong sweep/ejection motion framed by a counter-rotating vortex pair with elliptical cross-sections. As the canopy becomes denser, these important structures are shown here to be more elevated. Vegetation density does not appear to have a significant effect on the percentage of the total turbulent kinetic energy that is represented by the coherent structures.},

Excellent agreement between the experimental and the numerical results was achieved concerning the circulation, wake expansion and pitch of the helical tip vortex. A disagreement was found regarding the root vortex position and the axial velocity along the centre line of the tip vortex.

The major component of this work has been the provision of a suitable form of the model for regions where the turbulence Reynolds number is low. The model has been applied to the prediction of wall boundary-layer flows in which streamwise accelera-tions are so severe that the boundary layer reverts partially towards laminar. In all cases, the predicted hydrodynamic and heat-transfer development of the boundary layers is in close agreement with the measured behaviour.

Within the context of one-dimensional modelling, there is no clear advantage to including a turbulent kinetic dissipation rate (e) budget when l m can be specified instead. The broader implication is that the added complexity introduced by the e budget in K–e models need not translate into improved pre-dictive skills of U, K, and u 0 w 0 profiles when compared to single-equation models.},

abstract = {For wind resource assessment, the wind industry is increasingly relying on Computational Fluid Dynamics models that focus on modeling the airflow in a neutrally stratified surface layer. So far, physical processes that are specific to the atmospheric boundary layer, for example the Coriolis force, buoyancy forces and heat transport, are mostly ignored in state-of-the-art flow solvers. In order to decrease the uncertainty of wind resource assessment, the e↵ect of thermal stratification on the atmospheric boundary layer should be included in such models. The present work focuses on non-neutral atmospheric flow over complex terrain including physical processes like stability and Coriolis force. We examine the influence of these e↵ects on the whole atmospheric boundary layer using the DTU Wind Energy flow solver EllipSys3D. To validate the flow solver, measurements from Benakanahalli hill, a field experiment that took place in India in early 2010, are used. The experiment was specifically designed to address the combined e↵ects of stability and Coriolis force over complex terrain, and provides a dataset to validate flow solvers. Including those e↵ects into EllipSys3D significantly improves the predicted flow field when compared against the measurements. 1. Introduction Most Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers applied for atmospheric flows focus primarily on modeling the airflow in a neutrally stratified surface layer. In order to decrease the uncertainty, especially in complex terrain, the e↵ect of stability and Coriolis force on the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) should be included in such models. To get an appropriate description of the whole ABL, the DTU Wind Energy CFD solver EllipSys3D [1–3] is therefore modified accordingly. To validate the CFD solver and to get a better understanding of the influences of stability and Coriolis force on the resulting ABL flow over complex terrain, atmospheric experiments on full scale are necessary. Benchmark literature for these cases is, however, scarce. Various experiments are available that have been focusing on neutral flow over flat and complex terrain, e.g. the Askervein Hill experiment [4], or more recently the Bolund experiment [5, 6]. To validate non-neutral CFD solvers, however, large scale field experiments that capture the combined non-linear e↵ects of stability and Coriolis force over complex terrain are needed. The Benakenahalli field experiment was specifically designed to provide such a benchmark dataset. The topography and location of the site is well suited to study the interplay of these e↵ects. To simulate the airflow over Benakanahalli hill, the EllipSys3D solver is modified to get a more appropriate description of the whole ABL.},

abstract = {Canopy turbulence plays an important role in mass and energy exchanges at the canopy-atmosphere interface. Despite exten-sive studies on canopy turbulence over a flat terrain, less attention has been given to canopy turbulence in a complex terrain. The purpose of this study is to scrutinize characteristics of canopy turbulence in roughness sublayer over a hilly forest terrain. We investigated basic turbulence statistics, conditionally sampled statistics, and turbulence spectrum in terms of different atmospheric stabilities, wind direction and vertical structures of momentum fluxes. Similarly to canopy turbulence over a homogeneous terrain, turbulence statistics showed coherent structure. Both quadrant and spectrum analysis corroborated the role of intermittent and energetic eddies with length scale of the order of canopy height, regardless of wind direction except for shift of peak in vertical wind spectrum to relatively high frequency in the down-valley wind. However, the magnitude of the momentum correla-tion coefficient in a neutral condition was smaller than typical value over a flat terrain. Further scrutiny manifested that, in the up-valley flow, temperature skewness was larger and the contribution of ejection to both momentum and heat fluxes was larger compared to the down-valley flow, indicating that thermal instability and weaker wind shear in up-valley flow asymmetrically affect turbulent transport within the canopy.},

abstract = {Computations of channel flow with rough walls comprising staggered arrays of cubes having various plan area densities are presented and discussed. The cube height h is 12.5 {\%} of the channel half-depth and Reynolds numbers (u $\tau$ h/$\nu$) are typically around 700 – well into the fully rough regime. A direct numerical simulation technique, using an immersed boundary method for the obstacles, was employed with typically 35 million cells. It is shown that the surface drag is predominantly form drag, which is greatest at an area coverage around 15 {\%}. The height variation of the axial pressure force across the obstacles weakens significantly as the area coverage decreases, but is always largest near the top of the obstacles. Mean flow velocity and pressure data allow precise determination of the zero-plane displacement (defined as the height at which the axial surface drag force acts) and this leads to noticeably better fits to the log-law region than can be obtained by using the zero-plane displacement merely as a fitting parameter. There are consequent implications for the value of von ar an's constant. As the effective roughness of the surface increases, it is also shown that there are significant changes to the structure of the turbulence field around the bottom boundary of the inertial sublayer. In distinct contrast to two-dimensional roughness (longitudinal or transverse bars), increasing the area density of this three-dimensional roughness leads to a monotonic decrease in normalized vertical stress around the top of the roughness elements. Normalized turbulence stresses in the outer part of the flows are nonetheless very similar to those in smooth-wall flows.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional k-e turbulence model was developed to examine air flow both through and above a small forest stand submerged in an otherwise undisturbed boundary-layer flow. The effects of the forest canopy were modeled conventially using a sink for momentum and a source for the generation of turbulence energy. In addition, a further sink was added to the k- and e-budget equations to account for the additional loss of turbulence energy. The flow equations were solved using the PHOENICS fluid dynamic program by adding the necessary source/sink terms into the standard k-?? turbulence model. The thermal stratification is not included in the model simulation and wind tunnel experiment. Predictions from the model were compared against wind tunnel data, and good agreement was observed. Moreover, three different canopy shapes of the forest were introduced into the simulation. With the wind tunnel data as a reference, their results were compared and some useful conclusions were drawn. Finally, a design case study analyzed the effect of canopies on the wind environment of urban micro-climates. It showed that the developed tree canopy model is applicable in the design and evaluation stage.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the neutrally stratified flow over the Askervein Hill were performed, to improve the knowledge of the flow obtained from field measurements and numerical simulations with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods. A Lagrang-ian dynamic subgrid model was used but, to avoid the underdissipative character near the ground, it was merged with a damped Smagorinsky model. Simulations of a flat boundary-layer flow with this subgrid model showed that the turbulent vertical motions and shear stress were better resolved using grids with a stream to spanwise aspect ratio x//y = 2 than with an aspect ratio x//y = 1. Regarding the flow over the Askervein Hill, it was found that large-eddy simulations provide an acceptable solution for the mean-velocity field and better predictions of the turbulent kinetic energy in the upstream side of the hill than the k − $\epsilon$ model. However, as with the k − $\epsilon$ model, grid convergence was not achieved in the lee side and the size of the zone with reversed flow increased with the grid refinement. Nevertheless, the existence of the intermittent separation predicted with unsteady RANS in part one of this work seems unquestionable, due to the deceleration of the flow. In our opinion, a better modelling of the decelerating boundary layer in the lee side is required to improve the results obtained using equilibrium assumptions and achieve grid convergence.},

It was found that, when modelling the forest as a porous medium, the canopy drag dissipates the turbulent kinetic energy (acts as a sink term). The proposed model was then tested in more complex flows: a finite length forest and a forested hill. In the finite length forest, the destruction of the turbulent kinetic energy by the canopy was overestimated near the edge, for a length approximately twice the tree height. In the forested hill, the model was less accurate inside the recirculation zone and overestimated the turbulent kinetic energy, due to an incorrect prediction of the production term. Nevertheless, the canopy model presented here provided consistent results in both a priori and a posteriori tests and improved the accuracy of RaNS simulations with the k−$\epsilon$ model.},

abstract = {—Atmospheric stability classification is required to quantify the dispersion capabilities of the ambient atmosphere (i.e. the dispersion coefficients or the standard deviation of concentration distribution in lateral and vertical directions, W and X , respectively) in the air quality models for concentration predictions. Several different types of stability classification schemes are given depending on the availability of meteorological parameters and the related atmospheric processes in the lower part of the boundary layer. In the present study, atmospheric stabilities are estimated from seven different stability classification schemes based on Monin—Obukhov length, bulk and gradient Richardson numbers, temperature gradient, wind speed ratio, etc. The estimated stabilities are compared with the Pasquill stability classification which is very widely used and requires only routine data. The spread of stabilities in each scheme is large and sometimes it covers the entire range of stabilities for a given Pasquill class. However, it has been observed that the schemes based on Monin—Obukhov length and Richardson number gives reasonable comparison than the rest of the schemes. The performance of each of these schemes has been discussed based on the underlying physics. The study demonstrates that for a complete and exhaustive data set such as Kincaid, there exists a wide variations among all atmospheric stabilities with Pasquill and one another in a manner such that an entire range of stabilities may be obtained for a given Pasquill class. The implications of this on estimated distance to maximum ground level concentrations are great and could affect the overall outcome of conventional Gaussian models for industrial siting, planning and management.},

The present study shows how conven-tional techniques, linear models and cup anemometers, can be combined with flow simulation by computational fluid dynamics techniques (nonlinear models) and measurements by sonic anem-ometers, and discuss their relative merits in the characterisation of the wind over a coastal region—a cliff over the sea. The computa-tional fluid dynamic techniques were particularly useful, providing a global view of the wind flow over the cliff and enabling the identification of separated flow regions, clearly unsuitable for installation of wind turbines. These locations display a pulsating flow, with periods between 1 and 7 min, in agreement with sonic anemometer measurements, and both a turbulence intensity and a gust factor well above the wind turbine design conditions.},

From the collected on-site data the ambient turbulence intensity is calculated and analysed depending on the distance to the forest and height above the forest. From this forest turbulence intensity database it is possible to get an overview of the general behaviour of the turbulence above and down stream from the forest. The database currently consists of 65 measurements points from around the globe, and it will be continually updated as relevant sites are made available. Using the database a number of questions can be answered. How does the ambient turbulence intensity decay with height? What does the turbulence profile look like according to wind speed? Is it the general situation that high wind speeds are creating movement in the canopy tops, resulting in higher turbulence? How does the ambient turbulence intensity decay at different height as a function of distance to the forest? From the forest turbulence database it can be seen that in general, the majority of the turbulence intensity created by the forest is visible within a radius of 5 times the forest height in vertical and 500 meters downstream from the forest edge in horizontal direction. Outside these boundaries the ambient turbulence intensity is rapidly approaching normal values.},

abstract = {A deep understanding of turbulence structure is important for investigating the characteristics of the atmospheric bound-ary layer, especially over heterogeneous terrain. In the present study, turbulence intensity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) parameters are analyzed for different conditions with respect to stability, wind direction and wind speed over a valley region of the Loess Plateau of China during December 2003 and January 2004. The purpose of the study is to examine whether the observed turbulence intensity and TKE parameters satisfy Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), and analyze the wind shear effect on, and thermal buoyancy function of, the TKE, despite the terrain heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that the normalized intensity of turbulence follows MOST for all stability in the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as the normalized TKE in the horizontal direction. The shear effect of the wind speed in the Loess Plateau region is strong in winter and could enhance turbulence for all stability conditions. During daytime, the buoyancy and shear effect together constitute the generation of TKE under unstable conditions. At night, the contribution of buoyancy to TKE is relatively small, and mechanical shearing is the main production form of turbulence.},

detailed information on vegetation structure. A method is
presented to record 3D vegetation structure and make this

between wind speed, drag coefficient (CD) and plant area
density (PAD) was experimentally investigated in a mixed
conifer forest in the lower part of the Eastern Ore Mountains.
Essential information was gathered by collecting
multi-level high-frequency wind velocity measurements
and a dense 3D representation of the forest was obtained
from terrestrial laser scanner data. Wind speed dependence
or streamlining was observed for most of the wind directions.
Edge effects, i.e. the influence of the here not
regarded pressure gradient and the advective terms of the
momentum equation, are assumed to cause this heterogeneity.
Contrary to the hypothetic shelter effect, which
would reduce the drag on sheltered plant parts, the calculated
profiles of drag coefficients revealed an increasing CD
with PAD (i.e. a dependence on canopy and plant
structure).},

abstract = {A comparison of three two-equation turbulence models namely the standard k-$\epsilon$ model, Renormalized Group Theory (RNG) k-$\epsilon$ model and the k-$\omega$ model of Wilcox for flow over three different types of topographies have been presented in this paper. The present work is also an attempt to propose best practices for simulating atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows over complex terrain. Numerical investigations are performed for three different topographies: (i) cosine Hill (ii) Bolund Hill and (iii) Askervein Hill. The commercial CFD solver PHOENICS and the wind farm design tool WindSim V-5.1.0 are used for solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations with the turbulence closure. The profiles of velocity and turbulent kinetic energy obtained using the various turbulence models are compared with available experimental data. The numerical results clearly show the superiority of the k-$\omega$ model of Wilcox over the standard k-$\epsilon$ model and the RNG k-$\epsilon$ model for ABL flows. Though the velocity profiles obtained using all three models are alike there exists a significant variation in the turbulent kinetic energy profiles for the cases considered in this investigation. The models perform very well when the terrain orography is quite complex, except for the predictions on the leeward side of the Hill where the elliptic effects are more pronounced.

A mixed-order scheme is dee ned as a numerical method where the formal order of the truncation error varies either spatially, for example, at a shock wave, or for different terms in the governing equations, for example, third-order convection with second-order diffusion. The case examined is the Mach 8 inviscid ow of a calorically perfect gas over a spherically blunted cone. This oww eld contains a strong bow shock wave, where the formally second-order numerical scheme is reduced to rst order via a ux-limiting procedure. The proposed mixed-order error analysis method allows for nonmonotonic behavior in the solution variables as the mesh is ree ned. Nonmonotonicity in the local solution variables is shown to arise from a cancellation of rst-and second-order error terms for the present case.

This study investigates the effect of the inclusion of trees in numerical simulations of wind flow in urban area. Three approaches are used to include the dynamic effect of trees: the basic approach (tree effects are neglected), the implicit approach (tree effects are included in the surface parameterizations), and the explicit approach (trees are represented by porous media). Several test cases have been adopted in order to cover a wide range of urban complexities, wind directions, foliage den-sities, and tree planting configurations. The results show that there are significant effects of trees when the explicit approach is used compared to the basic and the implicit approaches. Thus tree effects need to be considered using an explicit approach to simulate wind flow in urban area. Also, many parameters such as wind direction, foliage density, and urban configuration are believed to influence the intensity of trees effects. This study emphasizes the importance to explicitly consider the effects of trees in numerical model investigations for the wind flow in urban areas.},

This is probably due to the additional source (and/or sink) terms, whose parameterization remained uncertain. This model must include source terms for both turbulent kinetic energy (k) and the viscous dissipation rate ($\epsilon$), to account for vegetation wake turbulence budget. In this note, we show how Kolmogorov's rela-tion allows for an analytical solution to be calculated within the portion of a dense and homogeneous canopy where the mixing length does not vary. By substitution within model equations, this solution allows for a set of constraints on source term model coefficients to be derived. Those constraints should meet both Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations and large-eddy simulation sub-grid scale turbulence modelling requirements. Although originating from within a limited portion of the canopy, the predicted coefficients values must be valid elsewhere in order to make the model capable of predicting the whole canopy-layer flow with a single set of constants.},

abstract = {This study presents two models to simulate a wind turbine. This is done by employing the 1D momentum actuator disc theory in PHOENICS, a general purpose computational fluid dynamics software. To test the general applicability of these models, single wind turbine simulations are conducted using eight different wind turbine models from two manufacturers. The simulations are performed by imposing sheared inflow with hub height wind speeds ranging from 3 m/s up to 25 m/s. A range of computational parameters are investigated, including the resolution of the domain, the thickness of the actuator disc and the iterative convergence criteria. To investigate the wake development produced by these methods, a comparison study is performed with the more complex large-eddy simulation software EllipSys3D using an actuator disc approach for validation purposes. The resulting wind turbine thrust and power outputs from PHOENICS are compared with the experimental power curves and thrust values provided by the manufacturers for each wind turbine. The results show that actuator disc methods are able to provide a reasonable estimation of the conventional wind turbine power and thrust output with low computational effort. Moreover, the results from the preliminary comparison of the wake produced from these two rotor models compare well with the wake produced by the actuator disc in EllipSys3D.},

abstract = {A knowledge of the distribution of the contribution of upwind sources to measurements of vertical scalar flux densities is important for the correct interpretation of eddy covariance data. Several approaches have been developed to estimate this so-called footprint function. Here a new approach based on the ensemble-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is presented. Comparisons of numerical results using this approach with results from other studies under a range of environmental conditions show that the model predictions are robust. Moreover, the approach outlined here has the advantage of a potential wide applicability, due to an ability to take into account the heterogeneous nature of underlying surfaces. For example, the model showed that any variations in surface drag, such as must occur in real life heterogeneous canopies, can exert a marked influence of the shape and extent of flux footprints. Indeed, it seems likely that under such circumstances, estimates of surface fluxes will be weighted towards areas of highest foliage density (and therefore quite likely higher photosynthetic rates) close to the measurement sensor. Three-dimensional footprints during the day and night were also determined for a mixed conifer-ous forest in european Russia. A marked asymmetry of the footprint in the crosswind direction was observed, this being especially pronounced for non-uniform plant distributions involving vegetation types with different morphological and physiological properties. The model also found that, other things being equal, the footprint peak for forest soil respiration is typically over twice the distance from the above canopy measurement sensor compared to that for canopy photosynthesis. This result has important consequences for the interpretation of annual ecosystem carbon balances by the eddy covariance method.},

abstract = {A modification of the most popular two-equation (E–ϕ) models, taking into account the plant drag, is proposed. Here E is the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and ϕ is any of the following variables: El (product of E and the mixing length l), $\epsilon$ (dissipation rate of TKE), and $\omega$ (specific dissipation of TKE, $\omega$ = $\epsilon$/E). The proposed modification is due to the fact that the model constants estimated experimentally for 'free-air' flow do not allow for adequate reconstruction of the ratio between the production and dissipation rates of TKE in the vegetation canopy and have to be adjusted. The modification is universal, i.e. of the same type for all E–ϕ models considered. The numerical experiments carried out for both homogeneous and heterogeneous plant canopies with E–ϕ models (and with the E–l model taken as a kind of reference) show that the modification performs well. They also suggest that E–$\epsilon$ and E–$\omega$ schemes are more promising than the E–El scheme for canopy flow simulation since they are not limited by the need to use a wall function. In addition, a new parameterization for enhanced dissipation within the plant canopy is derived. It minimizes the model sensitivity to C $\mu$ , the key parameter for two-equation schemes, and whose estimates unfortunately vary considerably from experiment to experi-ment. The comparison of results of new modified E–$\epsilon$ and E –$\omega$ models with observations from both field and wind-tunnel experiments shows that the proposed parameterization is quite robust. However, because of uncertainties with the turbulence Prandtl and Schmidt numbers for the E–$\epsilon$ model within the canopy, the E–$\omega$ model is recommended for future implementation, with the suggested modifications.},

The wind farm in analysis is located in Northern Sweden and has high orographic complexity with forested hilly terrain. There is 1 year record of met-mast wind measurements and nearly 2 years record of production data. Firstly, roughness and height data are given as input in order to simulate and generate the wind fields over the complex terrain. In addition, the forest model is used to get more detailed roughness height. After generating the wind fields, the existing turbine locations and 1-year wind speed measurements are imported. The results show how accurate the CFD calculations are to solve turbulence in complex terrain. Comparison between actual production data and simulated energy production values is the main approach of this thesis work to validate the simulations. The results indicate that both WAsP and WindSim overestimate the energy production and the wind speed. However, particularly when using the WindSim forest module, the CFD calculations have more accurate results than the WAsP estimations.},

Since LES turbulence models are computationally time consuming when applied to real geome-tries, RANS models are still widely used. However, RANS models are very sensitive to the chosen tur-bulence parametrisation and the results can vary according to the application. In this investigation, the simulation of the wind flow around an isolated building is performed using various types of RANS tur-bulence models in the open source code OpenFOAM, and the results are compared with benchmark experimental data. In order to confirm the numerical accuracy of the simulations, a grid dependency analysis is performed and the convergence index and rate are calculated. Hit rates are calculated for all the cases and the models that successfully pass a validation criterion are analysed at different regions of the building roof, and the most accurate RANS models for the modelling of the flow at each region are identified. The characteristics of the wind flow at each region are also analysed from the point of view of the wind energy generation, and the most adequate wind turbine model for the wind energy exploitation at each region of the building roof is chosen.},

abstract = {Four models of surface boundary-layer flow in complex terrain are compared with obser-vations made at Blashaval Hill, North Uist, Scotland. The field experiment is described by Mason and King (1985). Three of the models are derived from the two-dimensional theory of Jackson and Hunt (1975) and are described in Mason and King (1985), Walmsley et al. (1986) and Troen and Petersen (1989). The fourth is a mass-consistent code based on Traci et al. (1979). The model results are in good agreement with each other and are generally within the observed range of variation (-+ 16{\%}) in normalized wind speed. For most wind direcions (7 of ll), model results of normalized wind speed at the summit were within 7{\%} of the observed mean values. For some wind directions, calculations using the " Guidelines " of Walmsley et al. (1989) suggested that variations in surface roughness were important. This led us to apply one of our models incorporating nonuniform surface roughness. The lack of significant improvement for cases when water lay upstream of Blashaval Hill is attributed to compensating changes at summit and reference sites and to very local effects on the wind data. Sensitivity to topography lying to the west and northwest of Blashaval was also investigated. Results suggested an influence from those distant topographic features for some wind directions. When those features were incorporated, maximum errors in normalized wind speed at the summit were reduced from 18 to 13{\%}.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The effect of magnetic field strength and orientation on two types of electromagnetically influenced tur-bulent flows was studied numerically under the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) framework. Previous work (Wilson et al., 2014) used an electromagnetically extended linear eddy-viscosity model, whilst the current paper focuses on the performance of a more advanced Reynolds stress transport type model both with and without electromagnetic modifications proposed by Kenjere{\v{s}} et al. (2004). First, a fully-developed 2D channel flow is considered with a magnetic field imposed in either the wall-normal or streamwise direction. Both forms of the RSM gave good agreement with the DNS data for the wall-normal magnetic field across the range of Hartmann numbers with the additional electromagnetic terms provid-ing a small, but noticeable, difference. For the streamwise magnetic field, where electromagnetic influ-ence is only through the turbulence, the electromagnetically extended RSM performed well at moderate Hartmann numbers but returned laminar flow at the highest Hartmann number considered, contrary to the DNS. The RSM results were, however, significantly better than the previous eddy-viscosity model predictions. The second case is that of unsteady 3D Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection with a magnetic field imposed in either a horizontal or vertical direction. Results revealed that a signif-icant reorganization of the flow structures is predicted to occur. For a vertically oriented magnetic field, the plume structures increase in number and become thinner and elongated along the magnetic field lines, leading to an increase in thermal mixing within the core in agreement with Hanjali and Kenjere{\v{s}} (2000). With a horizontal magnetic field, the structures become two-dimensional and a striking realignment of the roll cells' axes with the magnetic field lines occurs. The results demonstrate the capa-bility of the Reynolds stress transport approach in modelling MHD flows that are relevant to industry and offer potential for those wishing to control levels of turbulence, heat transfer or concentration without recourse to mechanical means.},

abstract = {Turbulent flow in a corn canopy is simulated using large-eddy simulation (LES) with a Lagrangian dynamic Smagorinsky model. A new numerical represen-tation of plant canopies is presented that resolves approximately the local structure of plants and takes into account their spatial arrangement. As a validation, com-putational results are compared with experimental data from recent field particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and two previous experimental campaigns. Numerical simulation using the traditional modelling method to represent the canopy (field-scale approach) is also conducted as a comparison to the plant-scale approach. The combination of temporal PIV data, LES and spatial PIV data allows us to couple a wide range of relevant turbulence scales. There is good agreement between exper-imental data and numerical predictions using the plant-scale approach in terms of various turbulence statistics. Within the canopy, the plant-scale approach also allows the capture of more details than the field-scale approach, including instantaneous gusts that penetrate deep inside the canopy.},

@article{Zendehbad2016,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t In a wind farm whose turbines have either a forested or unforested fetch, measurements of the wind speed, wind direction and turbulence intensity are made with a 3D scanning LiDAR, and measurements of the tower head aeroelastic deflections are simultaneously made with an opto-mechanical measure-ment system. It is seen that in the forested fetch there is up to 2.5 times larger turbulence intensity than in the unforested fetch. Aeroelastic deflections of the tower during normal operation are up to 2.8 times larger for a turbine in forested fetch compared to a turbine in an unforested fetch. It is observed that the turbine with forested fetch has 17{\%} lower annual energy yield compared to a turbine in an unforested fetch. The deficits in the direction-wise energy yields are shown to be primarily a function of the up-stream streamwise extent of the forest. Furthermore, an analysis of the maintenance logs of the turbines shows that there are 2.2 times more fault durations per year and 20{\%} shorter time intervals between unscheduled and scheduled maintenances for a turbine in a forested fetch; thus more frequent sched-uled maintenances are recommended for turbines with a forested fetch.},
