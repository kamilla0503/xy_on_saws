	abstract = {The critical-point anomaly of a plane square m×n Ising lattice with periodic boundary conditions (a torus) is analyzed asymptotically in the limit n→ with ξ=mn fixed. Among other results, it is shown that for fixed τ=n(T-Tc)Tc, the specific heat per spin of a large lattice is given by Cmn(T)kBmn=A0lnn+B(τ,ξ)+B1(τ)(lnn)n+B2(τ,ξ)n+O[(lnn)3n2], where explicit expressions can be given for A0 and for the functions B, B1, and B2. It follows that the specific-heat peak of the finite lattice is rounded on a scale δ=ΔTTc∼1n, while the maximum in Cmn(T) is displaced from Tc by ε=(Tc-Tmax)Tc∼1n. For ξ0>ξ>ξ0-1, where ξ0=3.13927, the maximum lies above Tc; but for ξ>ξ0 or ξ<ξ0-1, the maximum is depressed below Tc; when ξ=,ξ0,orξ0-1, the relative shift in the maximum from Tc is only of order (lnn)n2. Detailed graphs and numerical data are presented, and the results are compared with some for lattices with free edges. Some heuristic arguments are developed which indicate the possible nature of finite-size critical-point effects in more general systems. © 1969 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Abstract.: We study the properties of the classical Ising model with nearest-neighbor interaction for spins located at the monomers of long polymer chains in 2 and 3 dimensions. We compare results for two ensembles of polymers with very different single chain properties: 1) swollen, self-avoiding linear polymer chains in good solvent conditions and 2) compact, space-filling randomly branching polymers in melt. By employing a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo computer simulations, we show that swollen polymers cannot sustain an ordered phase. On the contrary, compact polymers may indeed produce an observable phase transition. Finally, we briefly consider the statistical properties of the ordered phase by comparing polymer chains within the same universality class but characterized by very different shapes.

These polymers are modeled as self-avoiding walks on a cubic lattice, and the ferromagnetic interaction between the spins carried by the monomers is short-ranged in space. At low temperature, these polymers undergo a magnetic induced first order collapse transition, that we study at the mean field level. Contrasting with an ordinary Θ point, there is a strong jump in the polymer density, as well as in its magnetization. In the presence of a magnetic field, the collapse temperature increases, while the discontinuities decrease. Beyond a multicritical point, the transition becomes second order and Θ-like. Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising case are in qualitative agreement with these results.},

We study the critical exponents v and 2/14-7 as well as several universal amplitude ratios; in particular, we make an extremely sensitive test of the hyperscaling relation dv = 2/14-3'. In two dimensions, we contrtrm the predicted exponent v= 3/4 and the hyperscaling relation; we estimate the universal ratios (R2)/(R2)=O.14026++_O.O0007, (R 2)/(R 2) = 0.43961 + 0.00034, and ~* = 0.66296 + 0.00043 (68 % confidence limits). In three dimensions, we estimate v = 0.5877 + 0.0006 with a correction-to-scaling exponent A I = 0.56 _ 0.03 (subjective 68 % confidence limits). This value for v agrees excellently with the field-theoretic renormalization-group prediction, but there is some discrepancy for/it. Earlier Monte Carlo estimates of v, which were ~0.592, are now seen to be biased by corrections to scaling. We estimate the universal ratios (R2)/(R2)=O.1599++_O.O002 and ~*= 0.2471-I-0.0003; since ~*> 0, hyperscaling holds. The approach to ~* is from above, contrary to the prediction of the two-parameter renormalization-group theory. We critically reexamine this theory, and explain where the error lies. In an appendix, we prove rigorously (modulo some standard scaling assumptions) the hyperscaling relation dv = 2A 4-3, for two-dimensional SAWs. 661 0022.4715/95/0800-0661507.50/0 ~) 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation 662 Li et al.},

Using simple models of protein folding, we demonstrate systematically that there is a “designability principle” behind nature’s selection of protein folds. The designability of a structure (fold) is measured by the number of sequences that can design the structure—that is, sequences that possess the structure as their unique ground state. Structures differ drastically in terms of their designability. A small number of highly designable structures emerge with a number of associated sequences much larger than the average. These highly designable structures possess proteinlike secondary structures, motifs, and even tertiary symmetries. In addition, they are thermodynamically more stable and fold faster than other structures. These results suggest that protein structures are selected in nature because they are readily designed and stable against mutations, and that such a selection simultaneously leads to thermodynamic stability."

We compute the critical exponents, verifying the Coulomb-gas predictions, the $\theta$-point temperature T$\theta$ = 1.4986(11), and several invariant size ratios. Then, we focus on the geometrical features of the walks, computing the instantaneous shape ratios, the average asphericity, and the end-to-end distribution function. For the latter quantity, we verify in detail the theoretical predictions for its small- and large-distance behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
